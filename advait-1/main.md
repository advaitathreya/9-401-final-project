# A Framework for Science Communication

## Introduction
A society of people will want to make progress towards a better understanding of the world. Individal persons in this society have diverse motivators, including curiosity, the desire to help others, a pursuit of glory and prestige, and the desire to make money. The society will want to encourage people to pursue these motivators in a way that benefits the society as a whole.

### The Social Dynamics of Science
Today, we incentivize good science by rewarding scientists with prestige and money. Prestige is awarded by other scientists, and money is awarded by funders, predominantly the public. The government is incentivized to fund science because it benefits the society as a whole. Scientists are incentivized to do good science because it benefits them personally (this includes the satisfaction of helping others or learning).

In this notebook, we explore the incentives and structures that drive science, and how they can be improved.

## Key Considerations

### Science as a Strong-Link Problem
Science is a [strong-link problem](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/science-is-a-strong-link-problem). Progress is made when we incentivize diverse ideas, as hypothesis generation in vacuo cannot harm progress- it is only the exploration of the state space of the system. The harms of poor hypotheses come from the misaligned rationing of resources which leads to incomplete testing and the propagation of bad ideas. A robust system will be able to tolerate bad ideas, and a system that is too risk-averse will not be able to make progress. We explore ideas for making systems more robust with reviewing frameworks and recommender systems that surface good work and deprioritize bad work without gatekeeping or squashing good-faith exploration.

### Time and Attention as the Scarcest Resources
We assume that the scarcest resources in a society are time and attention. Making it easier for people to find and engage with good work will lead to more progress. As such, the incentives we consider are designed to optimize for the efficient use of time and attention.

### Goals for a Robust System
- **Incentivize diverse ideas**: We want to encourage people to generate diverse hypotheses, and to explore the state space of the system. We don't necessarily want to penalize people for generating bad ideas.
- **Incentivize good ideas**: We want to encourage people to generate good hypotheses, and to test them thoroughly. While bad ideas shouldn't be penalized, we still want to reward good ideas so that people are incentivized to generate them.
- **Incentivize constructive and critical collaboration**: We want to encourage people to work together to make progress, and to help each other improve their ideas. One way to do this is to get people to review each other's work, and to reward people for producing good reviews.
- **Highlight good work**: In the limited time that people have, we want them to be engaging with good work. What is "good" depends on individual people, and helping them find this is a priority. Good reviews and summaries of work can help with this.

## Some Ideas to Explore
We define any piece of work as **content**. This can be a hypothesis, a test, an observation, a review, a summary, or anything else.

### A credit system
- **Spending credits**: People need to spend credits to produce content. The amount of credits needed is proportional to the amount of attention that the content will demand. It can also be weighted by the topic and saturation of that region of the state space. If a piece of content is not particularly novel, then it should be more expensive to produce, as it adds to the noise without creating much of value. For instance, an article that already has a diverse set of reviews should be more expensive to review, as it is less likely to be useful to the community.
- **Earning credits**: However, if the piece of content produced saves someone's time, then the author of that content can earn credits. Time can be saved by helping someone decide whether or not to read a longer piece of content (with a review or a summary, for instance). It can also be saved by informing someone of a potential dead end for exploration.

### A recommender system
- **Recommending content**: How are pieces of content recommended to people? We can use a recommender system that takes into account the content that a person has already engaged with, and the content that other people with similar interests have engaged with. We can also take into account the content that people with dissimilar interests have engaged with, to encourage people to explore outside of their comfort zone.
